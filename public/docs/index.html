    <h1>API documentation Passmanagement</h1>
    <p>
        The Passmanagement API serves two important purposes: it is the backend for the Passmanagement user interface. Board members can use this interface to manage passes for the front door of De Bolk. Additionally, it manages access control for passes when scanned, granting access or denying it. The system maintains the history of all pass attempts.

    <a name="auth"><h2>Authentication &amp; authorisation</h2></a>
    <p>
        This API is protected as an OAuth2 resource server. You must retrieve a valid access token from <a href="https://auth.debolk.nl" title="auth.debolk.nl">auth.debolk.nl</a>. This access token must be included on every API request as a GET parameter:
    </p>
    <code>
        http://passmanagement.i.bolkhuis.nl/endpoint?access_token=XYZ
    </code>
    <p>
        This is a board-only system. Users must have board-level permissions or equivalent to be granted access to the API.
    </p>

    <a name="apireference"><h2>API reference</h2></a>
    <p>
        The API supports the following endpoints. All endpoints accept and return only JSON-encoded data. Note that all endpoints must be called with a valid OAuth2 access token (see <a href="#auth" title="authentication">authentication</a>). The listed responses and HTTP response codes are only sent when a request is succesful. If a fatal error occurs, an <a href="#errors" title="error response">error response</a> is sent instead.

    <a name="responses"><h2>Responses</h2></a>
    <p>
        A basic response object about a user has four properties: uid (string), name (string), pass (boolean) and access (boolean). The uid is the username of the Bolkaccount of this user. The name field contains the full name (first and last name) of the user. Note that users are not sorted by their name. The pass field is true if the user has a valid pass in the system, false otherwise. The access field is only true if the user is allowed to use the door, false otherwise. A user must have both these fields to be true to be able to enter the soos using the system.
    </p>
    <p>
        The /deur/checkpass call returns the status of the last pass which failed to gain access to the system. There are four possible responses which are sent with a HTTP 200 Okay response. Only if the response is "pass_okay" can the pass be added to a user. These responses are:
        <dl>
            <dt>pass_okay</dt>
            <dd>The last pass has scanned succesfully and can be added to a user</dd>

            <dt>door_response_not_okay</dt>
            <dd>The door cannot be reached</dd>

            <dt>pass_mismatch</dt>
            <dd>The last two passes that were scanned at the door are not identical</dd>

            <dt>entries_too_old</dt>
            <dd>The last pass was scanned more than 10 minutes ago</dd>
        </dl>
    </p>

    <a name="errors"><h2>Errors</h2></a>
    <p>
        The API returns JSON objects when an error occurs. An error response always has the following format:
    </p>

    <code>
        { <br>
            "code": "user_not_found", <br>
            "title": "User cannot be found", <br>
            "details": "The requested user could not found. It may have been deleted. ", <br>
            "href": "http://passmanagement.i.bolkhuis.nl/docs/#errors_user_not_found" <br>
        }
    </code>

    <p>
        The code is a string that refers to the application-specific error code. The title and details fields together form a coherent explanation of the error. You should show the title and details to the end-user and allow them to correct their mistake if applicable. You should not show the code field to the user, it is for internal usage only and is not guaranteed to be readable by humans. The href field refers to the error explanation in this documentation.
    </p>

    <p>
        In case of catastrophic server crashes and unexpected conditions, the API could return random PHP errors.
    </p>

        All possible error codes are listed in the table below.
